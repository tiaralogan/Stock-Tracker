## Description
The Stock Tracker application is built using Angular and makes use of an external API (Finnhub) to retrieve stock information. It provides a user interface that allows users to search for stocks by ticker symbol, and displays real-time stock data, including the current price, opening price, and closing price. Users can also add and remove stocks from a watchlist and view their performance over a 3 month period. Overall, the website's primary function is to provide users with a simple and intuitive way to track their favorite stocks and monitor their performance over time.
